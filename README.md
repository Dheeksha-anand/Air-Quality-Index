##🌟 Air Quality Prediction Application

Welcome to the Air Quality Prediction Application, a user-friendly tool that leverages machine learning to predict air quality categories based on AQI (Air Quality Index) values of major pollutants such as CO, Ozone, NO2, and PM2.5.

🚀 Features

✨ Real-Time PredictionsQuickly predicts the air quality category using pre-trained machine learning models.

✨ Interactive DesignSmooth transitions, user-friendly layout, and clean styling enhanced with dynamic animations.

✨ Custom StylingA visually appealing design with a gradient background and modern UI elements for a premium experience.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: Streamlit

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

Preprocessing: Data scaler and encoders (Pickle files)

Programming: Python

💻 Installation Guide

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

streamlit run app.py

🧪 How It Works

Input AQI Values: Enter AQI values for pollutants like CO, Ozone, NO2, and PM2.5.

Scaled Data: Inputs are preprocessed using a preloaded scaler for accuracy.

Prediction: A trained ML model predicts the air quality category instantly.

Result: The predicted AQI category is displayed on the screen in a visually prominent format.
